## API Setup

The CartApp utilizes FastAPI and OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo model. 

Here's how to set up the API:

1. Go to [platform.openai.com/](https://platform.openai.com/) and login or create an account
2. Inside of settings, add the billing information
3. Create an API key
4. Go to [replit.com/](https://replit.com/) and create a Replit account
5. Click on the `+ Create Repl` button to create a new Repl
6. Select the `FastAPI` template

7. Copy this code in the editor, it creates a FastAPI server with a POST endpoint that accepts an image file and returns the food item and its estimated price.

```python

from fastapi import FastAPI, File, HTTPException, UploadFile
from openai import OpenAI
import base64

app = FastAPI()
client = OpenAI(api_key="REPLACE WITH YOUR API KEY")

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Let's save some money yesssss!"}

@app.post("/")
async def get_openai_response_post(image: UploadFile = File(...)):
    try:
        image_content = await image.read()
        base64_image = base64.b64encode(image_content).decode(
            'utf-8')  # convert image to base64

        # send the image to OpenAI's GPT-4-o
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4o-mini",
            messages=[{
                "role":
                "user",
                "content": [
                    {
                        "type": "text",
                        "text": system_prompt
                    },
                    {
                        "type": "image_url",
                        "image_url": {
                            "url": f"data:image/png;base64,{base64_image}"
                        },
                    },
                ],
            }],
            max_tokens=15,  # limits how long the response can be
            top_p=0.1,
            temperature=0
        )  #uses common and fitting words instead of rare or strange ones so it makes the response more predictable

        # extract the food and price from the response

        food, price = response.choices[0].message.content.split('=')
        return {"food": food, "price": price}

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))


system_prompt = """
You are an agent specialized in tagging images of food and proving its possible price.
You will be provided with an image and your goal is to identify what food it is and it's estimated price.
The price shouldn't be the most updated, just give an estimate from stores like Walmart, Publix, Whole Foods, etc.
Return the food and the price in the format of a string separated with an equal sign, like this: Oldfashioned Oatmeal=3.99
If it's not food or you can't identify the price just return 'unknown' for both price and food.
If there are 2 or more food items in the image, return only one of them.
